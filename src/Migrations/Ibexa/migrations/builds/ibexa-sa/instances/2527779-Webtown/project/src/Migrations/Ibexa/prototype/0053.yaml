The people from low- and middle-income countries are most affected for 2 main reasons.  Firstly, there is less to no understanding of mental disorders in their country or community. Secondly, there is a lack of infrastructure i.e. limited availability of healthcare professionals or even basic treatments.</para><para>“In Senegal, for instance, a country of 20 million, there are just 12 psychiatrists and two neurologists,” says the Mental Health Global Program Leader at Helse. “Several countries have <emphasis>zero </emphasis>mental health professionals on the ground.”</para><para>Helse has committed to changing the Mental Health landscape by heavily investing resources. They plan to take advantage of their global status as the world's largest pharmaceutical company. They plan to destigmatize mental health in the same way as HIV and tuberculosis. We want as many patients as possible to receive quality mental healthcare.</para><para>Helse has started an initiative that started school programs at local universities. This program helps prepare Masters in Public Health students to initiate, develop and oversee mental health programs and policies around the world, as well as to conduct and critically evaluate research on global mental health</para><para>This primarily helps students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Scholarships are offered to students from low- and middle-income countries so they can take what they learn with them as they drive impact in their communities and around the world.</para><para>Now the program boasts of 100+ leaders in multiple countries that focus on different aspects of mental health, each from a country lacking adequate resources to treat psychological and psychiatric disorders.</para></section>

Wearable technology could hold the power to better understand patients and diseases to improve healthcare.</para><para>The early edition of  Fitbit® and Apple Watch®, which contains sensors. Depending on the type of device, sensors would detect many kinds of things, such as activity, temperature, heart rate, and heart rhythm.</para><para>When the data the devices collect is shared with healthcare professionals, including doctors and researchers, the measurements can potentially contribute to a deeper, fuller understanding of a person’s activities, movement patterns, and health far, far away from a doctor’s office—all at the patient’s convenience and with patient privacy as the cornerstone.</para><para>These devices are easy to wear, and the technology just keeps advancing so you can track all sorts of things. Plus, he adds, the use of the device doesn't depend upon a patient to recall their activities, which might be colored by personal opinions or feelings and result in bias in the data that’s being collected.</para><para>Helse has launched a new research center to study wearable technologies. The scientists test wearable sensors for a variety of applications—such as measuring a person’s gait or manner of walking—to gain a deeper understanding of how those measurements compare to traditional methods or measurements. Once these data points are validated then they can use these for their clinical trials.</para><para>In the future, we expect these devices and tools to increase the interaction and updates between the patient and healthcare provider.

By May 2020, that number declined to 49.7%.</para><para>A major driver of the downturn in vaccinations was canceled or skipped well-child visits. Shortly after the United States declared a national state of emergency in March 2020 to control the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, public health officials stressed the importance of social distancing and issued shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. These policies slowed the spread of the coronavirus, but also caused parents and healthcare providers to postpone doctors’ appointments and well-child visits to avoid any potential exposure to life-threatening contagious disease. So many caregivers delayed all non-emergency medical care, including vaccines for children.</para><para>Unfortunately, these missed well-child visits resulted in “significant declines incomplete vaccination coverage in children at all milestone ages.</para></section>
